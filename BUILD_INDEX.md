# How to build an index

The sentences branch uses a Lucene index to retrieve sentences quickly. This document will show you how to
build this index.

To get started, you need a folder that contains CoNLL column NER format files. These are the files that you
 want to annotate.

Open up TextFileIndexer.java.

Run it! You are good to go.
