US President Donald Trump is seeking to boost defence spending by 10% in his proposed budget plan for 2018 .
The blueprint will increase defence spending by $54bn ( Â£43bn ) but seeks to recoup that sum through deep cuts elsewhere , including to foreign aid .
Mr Trump's plan leaves large welfare programmes untouched , despite Republican calls for reform .
The president has consulted government agencies about his plans and will present his budget to Congress in May .
Between now and then , he needs to identify where the agencies can make savings and work out what he does with tax reform .
Republican John McCain said the $603bn defence budget - which White House officials outlined - would be insufficient .
Speaking at the White House during a meeting with state governors on Monday morning , Mr Trump said : " We're going to do more with less and make the government lean and accountable . "
The president , who vowed to increase military spending and preserve welfare programmes during his campaign , said the budget will focus on " military , safety , economic development " .
" It will include an historic increase in defence spending to rebuild the depleted military of the United States of America at a time we most need it , " he said .
