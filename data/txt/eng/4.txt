This is my standout look of the night.
We've all been so excited to see Raf Simons' first work with Calvin Klein, and this white dress just perfectly encapsulates his directional take on femininity and glamour.
Here his signature cool clean lines, with unexpected details like the cut out and the squared off train, are heightened by the stunning crust of sequins.
And Naomie hasn't gone overboard with the details - simple hair, asymmetric crystal suede sandals, also by Calvin Klein, and Bulgari jewellery.
We often imagine that Oscar dresses should look like an old-fashioned fairy tale princess fantasy, and I love the idea that the modern fairy tale princess ideal is more pared back.
Naomie looks amazing, and also entirely like herself - not over the top but incredibly glamorous.
I also love that Raf reached out to dress not just Naomi but her Moonlight co-stars, having seen the film and been blown away by it.
It's a great example of fashion and Hollywood being inspired by each other.
Obviously it's great that Emma Stone won an Oscar while dressed a bit like an Oscar, but this dress is also just perfect - for her, the film she is nominated for and for the ceremony.
One of Riccardo Tisci's last designs before he stepped down from Givenchy, it exudes gilded era old-school glamour, just like La La Land, and the ombre fringing brings a playfulness that fits with Emma's whole vibe.
Great jewellery too from Tiffany & Co, and a dash of politics with the addition of a gold Planned Parenthood pin.
Pharrell is a guy who is always having fun with fashion, but after years where his style has been dominated by the big hat, it was really nice to see him graduate to looking unquestionably stylish - while still pushing the envelope.
This look is head-to-toe-to-necklace Chanel - not a brand you often see men wearing on the red carpet - but entirely in keeping with Pharrell's creative energy.
